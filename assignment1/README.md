The Taubat√© Pregnant is having her kids soon. The problem is that they are too many and she needs a system to register them. Furthermore, this is not her only pregnancy, she is planning to get pregnant again.

Since they are too many, you need to create a software where the doctor can register each of them, regardless the order it is inserted. Your software should help her further, for instance, when she needs to call the kids for lunch to don't forget anyone.

    // If a given kid is older than the current one
    boolean isOlder(Baby baby)
